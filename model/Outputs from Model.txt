This is a basic file we can use to output the results of our tests as we modify the model.

Goals (for this branch at least): Get as high AUC, Precision, and Recall as possible

Model base code:

n_classes = 731
input_shape = (40,)
inputs = keras.Input(input_shape)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(n_classes, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs = inputs, outputs = predictions)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics = [keras.metrics.AUC(), keras.metrics.Precision(), keras.metrics.Recall()])

Model outputs:

Mean area under curve:  89.76372838020325
Mean precision:  44.914261028170586
Mean recall:  18.77666436135769

Conclusion, attempt to focus towards raising precision and recall
